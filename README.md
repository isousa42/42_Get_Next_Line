> *"Reading a line on a fd is way too tedious"*

<p> The aim of this project is to make a fuction that will return a complete line, when it finds a newline. </br></p>
<p> This function will read from a **File Descriptor** and must be called in a loop until it ends the **EOF** (End of File). </br></p>
